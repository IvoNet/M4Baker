# M4Baker

M4Baker bakes mp3 files to Audiobook format (m4b).

I am building it with my personal wishes and needs in mind as I am the developer and the main user :-)
The design is with ease of use in mind.

![](doc/Screen-main.png)

* Mandatory fields
    * Title
    * Artist
    * Cover Art
    * MP3 files
* When at least the mandatory fields are filled the "Queue" button will become available
* When Queued processing of the project will begin, and the current project windows will be cleaned to start a new one.
* The progress of all queued projects can be seen on the Queue tab.
* In theory, you can Queue as many projects as you want, depending on the capacity of your machine.
* Processes that are stopped (x) or have failed for some reason will show in red
* Successfully completed projects will show up green.
* A stopped process can be removed from the queue by using the (x) in the entry.

Projects can be saved to files called *.m4baker and reopened through the app or recent history. I want to associate the
files to the app but don't know how yet.

## Download release

* Please read this blog about [Open "Unidentified Developer" Apps On Your Mac](http://ivo2u.nl/ZO)
    * These are the consequences of writing free software:
        * I am not in the position to [sign](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) my code
          "The Apple Way" as I am not prepared to pay $99 a year to give away (less than) free software ðŸ˜„. This means
          that you might have to perform some extra steps to be able to run a (possible future) distribution on your
          machine.
        * You can not expect support from me in any way. As long as I am happy with how it works I hope you like it to.
          Feature requests will only be honoured if I see a benefit in it. You are of course always free to create a
          Pull Request with your proposed feature.

* Working on releasing my software now.... (look for updates here or on my [website](https://www.ivonet.nl)

# Donations / Appreciation

* If you like this software and think I deserve a nice cold beer, or a good cup of coffee you can consider buying me a
  coffee [donation](http://ivo2u.nl/ZC).
* Just showing your appreciation on Twitter is almost just as nice!

# Building from source

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (brew install python)

To be placed in src/resources:

- ffmpeg (brew install ffmpeg)
- ffprobe (brew install ffmpeg)
- mp4chaps (brew install mp4v2)
- mp4art (brew install mp4v2)
- AtomicParsley (brew install AtomicParsley)
- mp3binder (build from source: https://github.com/crra/mp3binder)

how...

```shell
cp -vf "$(which ffmpeg)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which ffprobe)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which mp4chaps)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which mp4art)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which AtomicParsley)" "./src/resources"
```

Not yet sure if I need them all but will adjust as needed :-)

## Create environment

To create and activate the environment

```shell
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry 
poetry install
```

## Usage

```shell
cd PROJECT
source venv/bin/activate
python src/m4baker.py

# or

DEBUG=True python src/m4baker.py # Will show extra debug logging in the log window
```

## Build Mac App

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
./build.sh [clean]
```

The clean option will first remove the build and dist folder before rendering all the images to the
ivonet/image/images.py file and building the application

See also the build.sh script

## Rendering the images

```shell
./images.sh
```

This script will convert all the ./images/*.{bmp,png} images to a format easily understood by wxPython.
