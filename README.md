# M4B Baker

M4Baker bakes mp3 files to Audiobook format (m4b).

I am building it with my personal wishes and needs in mind as I am the developer and the main user :-)
The design is with ease of use in mind.

![](doc/Screen-main.png)

* Mandatory fields
    * Title
    * Artist
    * Cover Art
    * MP3 files
* When at least the mandatory fields are filled the "Queue" button will become available
* When Queued processing of the project will begin, and the current project windows will be cleaned to start a new one.
* The progress of all queued projects can be seen on the Queue tab.
* In theory, you can Queue as many projects as you want, depending on the capacity of your machine.
* Processes that are stopped (x) or have failed for some reason will show in red
* Successfully completed projects will show up green.
* A stopped process can be removed from the queue by using the (x) in the entry.

Projects can be saved to files called *.ivo (for now) and reopened through the app or recent history. I want to
associate the files to the app but don't know how yet.

## Download release

* TODO no release has been made yet als I am very much in testing and tuning phase now, but you can build or run from
  source. for instructions see the Developers section. Richt now I am building this with a MacBook in mind but as it is
  written in Python with wxPython it should be portable to Windows / Linux? I will probably not invest any time it
  porting, but if you want to collaborate or improve the code in any other way please drop me a PM on Twitter (@ivonet).

* As of version 0.1.2 it should build into a kinda "fully" working version with lots of rough edges
  (very alpha!)

* Version 0.4.4 has a newer look and feel (single page) and should be a bit more stable :-) working on it!

## Extra note

* I write this software as OpenSource and don't expect to be paid for it. I write this stuff for myself and that makes
  me happy.
* These are the consequences of writing free software:
    * I am not in the position to [sign](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) my code
      "The Apple Way" as I am not prepared to pay $99 a year to give away (less than) free software ðŸ˜„. This means that
      you might have to perform some extra steps to be able to run a (possible future) distribution on your machine.
    * You can not expect support from me in any way. As long as I am happy with how it works I hope you like it to.
      Feature requests will only be honoured if I see a benefit in it. You are of course always free to create a Pull
      Request with your proposed feature.

# Donations / Appreciation

* If you like this software and think I deserve a nice cold beer, or a good cup of coffee you can consider giving me
  a [donation](http://ivo2u.nl/Zc).
* Just showing your appreciation on Twitter is almost just as nice!

# If you are a Developers

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (brew install python)

To be placed in src/resources:

- ffmpeg (brew install ffmpeg)
- mp4chaps (brew install mp4v2)
- mp4art (brew install mp4v2)
- AtomicParsley (brew install AtomicParsley)
- mp3binder (build from source: https://github.com/crra/mp3binder)

how...

```shell
cp -vf "$(which ffmpeg)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which ffprobe)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which mp4chaps)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which mp4art)" "./src/resources"
cp -vf "$(which AtomicParsley)" "./src/resources"
```

Not yet sure if I need them all but will adjust as needed :-)

## Create environment

To create and activate the environment

```shell
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry 
poetry install
```

## Usage

```shell
cd PROJECT
source venv/bin/activate
python src/m4baker.py
```

## Build Mac App

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
./build.sh [clean]
```

The clean option will first remove the build and dist folder before rendering all the images to the
ivonet/image/images.py file and building the application

See also the build.sh script

## Rendering the images

```shell
./images.sh
```

This script will convert all the ./images/*.{bmp,png} images to a format easily understood by wxPython.

## Collaboration

If you want to collaborate on this project to improve it or give in more functionality please drop me a PM on twitter (
