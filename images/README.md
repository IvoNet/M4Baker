# Images folder

This folder contains the images used in the application for e.g. the toolbar and the about image

The images are rendered to Python code by the `images.sh` script in the root of the project

In order to work correctly these images need to adhere to a couple of rules...

## Rules

The image names need to be:

* lowercase
* snake_cased
* without spaces
* basename - ext = unique
